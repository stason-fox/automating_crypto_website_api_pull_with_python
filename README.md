# Automating Crypto Website API Pull With Python

#### Description: Automating a cryptocurrency website API pull. Tools used: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Excel.

I used Python and Jupyter Notebook to automate an API pull from CoinMarketCap.com. I created a function that fetches an API and appends it to the dataframe each time it is run. I also created a for loop that runs the function once per minute. I used Pandas for formatting and Seaborn to create a chart.
